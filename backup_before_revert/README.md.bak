# Run Faster — static site

Open `hello.html` in your browser to view the site. On macOS you can run:

```bash
open hello.html
```

Files added:
- `hello.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — simple styling
- `script.js` — pace calculator logic

Images added:
- `images/shoe.svg` — simple running shoe illustration (editable SVG)
- `images/stopwatch.svg` — stopwatch icon (editable SVG)

Using open images:
- To replace with photos, prefer CC0 / Creative Commons images from sources like Wikimedia Commons, Pexels, or Pixabay. Example searches: "runner", "track", "sprint".
- If you want, I can fetch a few candidate photos and add them under `images/` (I will only add images with permissive licenses).

If you want a different page name or additional sections (blog, images, or a deployment setup), tell me and I'll add them.
